This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

ToDo:
- [ ] Convert to using Express with Swaggerfy, e.g., https://github.com/cdimascio/generator-express-no-stress
- [ ] Add express-actuator: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-actuator

## Installation
Just have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

## Usage
```bash
# Build from Dockerfile
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

```bash
# Run a Docker Container in what we're calling "development mode" so that you
# can edit the files in the web/src/ directory and see it immediately in the
# running container. This is done with two key changes to the "docker run" step:
# 1. Use nodemon instead of npm to start the application.
# 2. Map a volume from your web/src/ directory into the container where the code lives
docker-compose up -d
```

```bash
# View the Swagger UI interface:
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

```bash
# Bring down the container
docker-compose down -v
```
